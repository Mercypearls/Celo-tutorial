# Implementing Celo Blockchain Oracles for External Data Integration

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to leverage Celo blockchain oracles to integrate external data into smart contracts and DApps. The ability to access off-chain data is crucial for real-world use cases, and decentralized oracles provide a reliable and secure way to fetch and verify this data within the Celo ecosystem.

We will be using Hardhat, a popular development environment for Ethereum and Celo, to build our project. Hardhat provides a robust framework and toolset for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Basic knowledge of Solidity and smart contract development.
2. Node.js installed on your machine.
3. Familiarity with Hardhat. If you're new to Hardhat, you can refer to the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/) for installation and setup instructions.

## Setting up the Project

Let's start by setting up a new Hardhat project.

1. Create a new directory for your project:

   ```bash
   mkdir celo-oracles-tutorial
   cd celo-oracles-tutorial


2. Initialize a new Hardhat project:

```bash
npx hardhat init
